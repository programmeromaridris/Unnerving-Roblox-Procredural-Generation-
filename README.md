# Unnerving-Roblox-Branch-Procredural-Generation-
Made as a side project to test out making backrooms/liminal spaces out of procedural generation.

This script implements a recursive procedural generation system designed to create organic, branching structures across a grid-based map. The algorithm utilizes recursive function calls to build "branches" composed of individual parts, applying randomized "wobble" rotations to simulate natural curvature. Key features include configurable survival rates, split probabilities for multi-branching, and generation depth limits to control complexity. The system is optimized for performance through asynchronous task spawning and periodic yielding, allowing for the simultaneous generation of multiple unique structures without stalling the game engine.
